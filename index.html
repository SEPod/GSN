• These Structural Drawings are part of the Contract Documents and shall be used in conjunction with the Architectural, Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, Fire Protection, and Project Manual/Specifications. Where discrepancies exist between disciplines, notify the Structural Engineer of Record (SER) for clarification prior to proceeding with the affected work. Do not scale drawings.

• The Contractor shall verify all existing conditions, dimensions, and elevations in the field prior to fabrication or construction. Conflicting, missing, or unclear information shall be brought to the attention of the SER before work proceeds.

• These drawings depict the completed structure only. The Contractor is solely responsible for all means, methods, techniques, sequences, procedures, temporary supports, shoring, bracing, construction loads, and safety measures required to complete the Work in accordance with the Contract Documents and governing safety regulations.

• Field modifications to structural members, connections, reinforcing, or specified details are not permitted without prior written approval from the SER. Cutting, notching, drilling, or burning of structural members shall be performed only where shown on the drawings or specifically approved in writing by the SER.

• Written approval from the Owner’s representative and SER is required for any proposed change that may affect structural performance, including substitutions, value engineering changes, or re-use of existing members beyond what is shown on the drawings.

• Shop drawing, submittal, and RFI responses by the SER are for general conformance with design intent and are not a substitute for the Contractor’s responsibility to coordinate, verify dimensions, and ensure constructability.

• Where typical details and general notes appear on these drawings, they apply to all similar conditions, whether or not indicated at each location, unless specifically noted otherwise (UNO).

• Coordinate openings, sleeves, blockouts, and embedded items required by other trades with structural framing and reinforcing shown on the drawings. Penetrations not shown shall be located and detailed in coordination with the SER before installation.

• All work shall comply with applicable Federal, State, and local safety regulations (including OSHA) and the Owner’s safety policies. The Contractor is responsible for jobsite safety and for protecting adjacent structures, utilities, and the public.

For sites outside mapped flood hazard areas, indicate status accordingly based on the civil/architectural code summary.

• Soils and Foundations: Indicate allowable bearing pressures, lateral earth pressures, friction coefficients, and other design soil parameters taken from the Geotechnical Report used for design, referencing report title, author, and date. Where no Geotechnical Report is provided, document the presumptive values and limitations used in design.

• Deflection and Drift Criteria: Structural systems and members are designed to satisfy applicable deflection and story drift limits per IBC, ASCE 7, and material standards (e.g., L/240, L/360, L/480, H/400, and project-specific criteria for finishes, cladding, or equipment as applicable).

• Special Inspections and Structural Tests shall be provided in accordance with IBC Chapter 17, the adopted building code, and the Statement of Special Inspections (SSI) prepared by the Registered Design Professional in Responsible Charge (RDPiRC) and approved by the building official.

• The Statement of Special Inspections and associated schedules (for steel, concrete, masonry, wood, soils, deep foundations, sprayed fire-resistive materials, fire-resistant penetrations, and other items) shall be included in the construction documents or submitted separately to the building official, as required by the jurisdiction.

• The Owner shall engage independent testing and inspection agencies, acceptable to the building official and SER, to perform the required tests and special inspections. These agencies shall not be employed by the Contractor or any subcontractor responsible for the Work being inspected.

• The Contractor shall notify the testing and inspection agencies in advance of all work requiring special inspection or testing and shall provide safe access to the work and the approved construction documents for reference.

• Nonconforming work or test results shall be reported by the special inspector to the Contractor and SER. Correct nonconforming work before it is concealed or before proceeding with work that depends on it. The SER shall be consulted regarding any required remedial measures.

• A Final Report of Special Inspections, sealed by the RDPiRC or as required by the building official, shall be submitted at completion of construction to document that all required inspections and tests have been performed and that nonconforming items have been resolved.

• Observation of construction by the SER or their representatives is for general conformance with design intent and does not constitute continuous inspection, special inspection, or supervision of the Contractor’s means and methods.

• Field test and inspection reports shall be distributed to the Owner, Contractor, SER, and building official (where required) in a timely manner and maintained at the jobsite for review.
